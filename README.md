# Google Appscript Tutorials

Welcome to this tutorial on Google Apps Script! This repository contains code examples and explanations that will help you get started with Google Apps Script, a scripting language based on JavaScript that allows you to automate tasks and extend functionality within Google Workspace.

## Getting Started

To get started with Google Sheets Apps Script, you'll need a Google account and access to Google Sheets. Follow these steps to create a new script:

- Open a Google Sheet.
- Click on the "Extensions" menu and select "Appscript".

Now you're ready to start writing code! You can write and run code directly in the script editor, which includes a code editor, debugger, and other helpful tools.

## Examples

All examples contain both the .csv and the .gs files. First, import the .csv into the sheet. Then to try out these examples, simply open the .gs file for the example you are interested in and copy the code into a new script file in your own Apps Script project.
